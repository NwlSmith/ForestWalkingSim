        Hello... Could you help me?
        I’m lost and can’t find my way home.
        <<PlayerSpeak>>
        Your grandmother sent me to find you.
        <<NPCSpeak>>
        Really? That sounds just like her! She can always sense when I’m in trouble.
        She’s a great lady.
        <<PlayerSpeak>>
        Your home is just around the corner.
        <<NPCSpeak>>
        Is it really?
        My sense of direction has never been good...
        Thanks, stranger. I won't wander off again.

        <<NPCSpeak>>
        Did you need something? I'm about to head back.
        <<PlayerSpeak>>
        I'll see you there.
